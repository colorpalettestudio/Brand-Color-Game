⚠️ NEEDS SMALL CORRECTIONS / TIGHTENING
Tiffany & Co.

Color code: #0ABAB5 ❌

Issue: This is too green. Tiffany Blue is closer to:

HEX: #81D8D0

Fun fact: ✔️ Correct, but clarify wording:

PMS 1837 (not “PMS 1837 Blue”) is correct.

✅ Fix: Update hex only.

Target

Color code: #CC0000 ✔️ acceptable

Fun fact: ⚠️ Not provably documented

Target did standardize red carefully, but “tested various shades and found this specific one” is marketing lore.

✅ Safer wording:

“Target’s bold red was chosen to be instantly recognizable and energetic across stores and advertising.”

Coca-Cola

Color code: #F40009 ✔️ reasonable

Fun fact: ⚠️ Slightly misleading

Coke does use Pantone matches internally (commonly referenced: Pantone 484), even though it’s treated as proprietary.

✅ Safer wording:

“Coca-Cola Red is proprietary and carefully controlled, with custom formulations across different materials.”

Hermès

Color code: #F37021 ⚠️ Slightly off

More accurate common approximation: #FF7A00

Fun fact: ✔️ Correct

John Deere

Fun fact: ⚠️ Slightly interpretive

The symbolism is commonly stated but not officially branded as “harvest time.”

✅ Safer wording:

“The green and yellow reflect agriculture and visibility in outdoor environments.”

Barbie

Color code: #E0218A ✔️ acceptable

Fun fact: ⚠️ Trademark nuance

Mattel does not fully own all pink, but owns specific trademarked uses.

✅ Safer wording:

“Barbie Pink is a trademarked color used by Mattel to represent femininity, optimism, and playfulness.”

NBC

Color code: #FFC200 ⚠️ Peacock actually uses multiple colors

Fun fact: ✔️ Correct

✅ Optional: Note that the peacock uses a rainbow palette, not a single yellow.

IBM

Color code: #006699 ⚠️

IBM’s common hex is closer to #1F70C1 or #0062FF

Fun fact: ✔️ Correct

Pepsi

Fun fact: ❌ WWII claim is incorrect

Pepsi introduced blue prominently after WWII, but not specifically “to show support during WWII.”

✅ Corrected fact:

“Pepsi added blue to its logo in the 1950s to differentiate from Coca-Cola and emphasize its American identity.”

Cadbury

Color code: #482683 ✔️

Fun fact: ❌ Incorrect

Cadbury purple was not Queen Victoria’s favorite color.

It was registered to honor Queen Victoria’s Royal Warrant.

✅ Corrected fact:

“Cadbury purple was chosen to honor Queen Victoria after Cadbury received a Royal Warrant in 1901.”

Yahoo

Color code: #410093 ✔️

Fun fact: ⚠️ Oversimplified

Early offices were painted purple, but the choice was also about standing out digitally.

✅ Safer wording:

“Yahoo adopted purple to stand out online and embraced it early in the company’s startup culture.”

Roku

Formatting issue:

**Fun Fact :** line break glitch

Fact: ✔️ Correct
